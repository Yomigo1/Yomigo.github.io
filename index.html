<p>Macaroni and cheese is a dish that is cooked with macaroni pasta and cheese sauce, most commonly, cheddar cheese. Its origins trace back to cheese and pasta casseroles dating to the 14th century in Italy and medieval England.</p>
<p>Personally, <b>I love this dish because I love pasta and cheese!</b> It is <i>delicious</i> and that is why I will be sharing my own recipe today!</p>

<h2>Instructions for recipe:</h2>

<ol>
   <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6.</li>

   <li>Cook the macaroni in boiling salted water until ‘al dente’, then drain and refresh under cold, running water.</li>

   <li>Heat the butter in a pan and stir in the flour and mustard to make a roux (…a really thick sauce). Gradually add the milk, beating continuously with a whisk, until the mixture is smooth. Slowly bring to the boil over a low heat and whisk frequently until the mixture thickens.</li>

   <li>Stir the cheddar cheese into the white sauce and mix well until the cheese has melted. Add the cooked macaroni, cauliflower, proscuitt and shredded sprouts to the sauce and mix well. Season with sea salt and black pepper and spread the mixture into a large, wide gratin dish.</li>

   <li>Combine the parmesan cheese with breadcrumbs and olive oil, sprinkle over the top of the macaroni mixture and bake for around 30 minutes until the topping is golden and crisp and the middle is piping hot. Serve immediately.</li>
